  "body": "# Requirements\r\n\r\nYou're gonna need a browser (exHelp might work in Node.js, but I cannot confirm that it does). Having a text editor might be useful as well, or maybe you are just **that** fancy that you even use an IDE like VisualStudio, in which case I have great news: All functions have documentation comments, so autocompletion should work!\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\nAdd the \"exHelp.js\" or \"exHelp.min.js\" to your document via script tags\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"/js/lib/exHelp.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n\r\nyou can also load it asynchronously (just make sure that jQuery is loaded synchronously, **will be fixed to support complete async loading in next patch**)\r\n\r\n    <script async src=\"/js/lib/exHelp.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n\r\nIf you want to make use of the Date Helper plugin, also load the \"exHelp_Date[.min].js\" file, it shouldn't matter where you load it, since it hooks asynchronously to exHelp, but just to be sure do it after the main file. Same goes for the DOM Plugin which can be found under the \"exHelp_Element[.min].js\" file.\r\n\r\nNow you should have the exHelp available and you can create a shortcut to exHelp like so:\r\n    \r\n    var app = window.exHelp;\r\n\r\nNow all exHelp functionality is accessible via the `app` object. For example:\r\n\r\n    var myStorage = app.storage(\"temp_data\"); // Create a new storage object\r\n    // save data to storage\r\n    myStorage.username = \"test\";\r\n    myStorage.password = app.random.string(6); // Get a random string of length 6\r\n\r\n# Extending\r\n\r\nYou can also add your own functions to exHelp. Assume we have got an object with a few functions:\r\n\r\n    var o = {\r\n        times: function(num, multi)\r\n        {\r\n            return num * multi;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nWe can now add this function to exHelp:\r\n\r\n    app.extend(o);\r\n\r\nand then you can simply call\r\n\r\n    app.times(2, 4); // = 8\r\n\r\n# Best practice\r\n\r\nIn my opinion (or at least, this is how I do it) put all your functions inside exHelp, this will make everything neat and organized, you can even add your own \"subclasses\" to keep everything categorized.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n    var o = {\r\n        custom: {\r\n            myFnc1: function(e)\r\n            {\r\n                return e * e;\r\n            },\r\n            myFnc2: function(e)\r\n            {\r\n                // You can use this.\r\n                return this.myFnc1(e) * e;\r\n            },\r\n            myFnc3: function(e)\r\n            {\r\n                // Or you can use your exHelp shortcut, if you have set it up as a global variable\r\n                return app.custom.myFnc2(e) * e;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    app.extend(o);\r\n\r\nnow you can easily access you new functions via:\r\n\r\n    app.custom.myFnc1(2);\r\n    app.custom.myFnc2(4);\r\n    app.custom.myFnc3(8);\r\n\r\nOf course, this is a rudimentary way of setting up your exHelp. The graceful (and mobile friendly) way would be to load your \"setup\" code in a  self-executing function within a script file\r\n\r\n    (function MyAppSetup(window)\r\n    {\r\n    })(window);\r\n\r\nIf you don't know, this creates the function `MyAppSetup` within the scope of the parenthesis and then executes it since we have a trailing () after the parenthesis that hold the function. We pass the window variable for consistency. All of this ensures that the function will be executed as soon as the javascript file is done loading as well as keeping all local variables enclosed within the scope of our \"quasi-constructor\".\r\n\r\nBest case you want the file to even load asynchronously (so it doesn't block rendering of the websites, e.g. on mobile devices), so we add this little tidbit at the top of our constructor after adding the `async` attribute on the script tag:\r\n\r\n    (function MyAppSetup(window)\r\n    {\r\n        if (window['exHelp'] == void 0)\r\n            return setTimeout(MyAppSetup, 100, window);\r\n    })(window);\r\n\r\nThis checks whether `exHelp` exists in the global `window` (We compare to `void 0` instead of `undefined` and use the array annotation instead of object to avoid fatal errors during script execution which would block everything else from working.\r\n\r\nSo if `exHelp` doesn't exist globally (which it exposes itself to after initialization), it stops execution right there, then tries again in 100 ms (which in most cases is more than enough), which also explains why we don't use an anonymous function here. We need the name to be able to call it again.\r\n\r\nSo now we have to different paths we can go, either you want to make an exHelp Plugin (Like exHelp Date Helper) or you want to actually develop your system with it, depending on which you want to do, we have to do slightly different things (but easy enough to remember) - but remember, the plugin way _always_ works!\r\n\r\n## Plugin\r\n\r\n    (function MyPluginSetup(window)\r\n    {\r\n        if (window['exHelp'] == void 0)\r\n            return setTimeout(MyPluginSetup, 100, window);\r\n\r\n        var myPlugin =\r\n            {\r\n                myFunction: function (a, b)\r\n                {\r\n                    return parseInt(a) * parseInt(b);\r\n                },\r\n                anotherFunction: function(a)\r\n                {\r\n                    return myPlugin.myFunction(a, a * 2);\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n    \r\n        window.exHelpExtend(myPlugin);\r\n    })(window);\r\n\r\nYou create your object that holds all functions of your plugin, then extend the exHelp base object.\r\n\r\nWithin a plugin, you either back-reference with the `this` keyword or if you need a function from a different scope of your plugin, you use the object name that you are initializing it with.\r\n\r\n## System\r\n\r\n    (function MyAppSetup(window)\r\n    {\r\n        if (window['exHelp'] == void 0)\r\n            return setTimeout(MyAppSetup, 100, window);\r\n    \r\n        var myapp = new exHelp();\r\n    \r\n        // Extending is optional, but recommended\r\n        var baseExtension =\r\n            {\r\n                info:\r\n                    {\r\n                        AppName: \"My App\",\r\n                        Version: \"1.0.0\",\r\n                        Author: \"Leroy Jenkins\"\r\n                    },\r\n                \r\n                myFunction: function (a, b)\r\n                {\r\n                    return parseInt(a) * parseInt(b);\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n    \r\n        myapp.extend(baseExtension);\r\n    \r\n        // Expose\r\n        window.m = myapp;\r\n    })(window);\r\n\r\nSo you want to actually USE exHelp? Follow the design outlined above. You expose exHelp into a variable - optionally you can also extend your exHelp object with your own functions here (which you will want to do) and then extend them.",
