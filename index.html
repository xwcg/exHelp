<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h1>

<p>You're gonna need a browser (exHelp might work in Node.js, but I cannot confirm nor deny it) and jQuery (any version 1.7+ should do). Having a text editor might be useful as well, or maybe you are just <strong>that</strong> fancy that you even use an IDE like VisualStudio, in which case I have great news: All functions have documentation comments, so autocompletion should work!</p>

<h1>
<a name="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h1>

<p>Add the "exHelp.js" or "exHelp.min.js" to your document via script tags</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="/js/lib/exHelp.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you can also load it asynchronously (just make sure that jQuery is loaded synchronously, <strong>will be fixed to support complete async loading in next patch</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script async src="/js/lib/exHelp.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to make use of the Date Helper plugin, also load the "exHelp_Date[.min].js" file, it shouldn't matter where you load it, since it hooks asynchronously to exHelp, but just to be sure do it after the main file.</p>

<p>Now you should have the exHelp Prototype available and you can create a new exHelp instance by calling:</p>

<pre><code>var app = new exHelp();
</code></pre>

<p>Now all exHelp functionality is accessible via the <code>app</code> object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var myStorage = app.storage("temp_data"); // Create a new storage object
// save data to storage
myStorage.username = "test";
myStorage.password = app.random.string(6); // Get a random string of length 6
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="extending" class="anchor" href="#extending"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extending</h1>

<p>You can also add your own functions to exHelp, either by extending the current instance or by extending all current and future instances.</p>

<p>Assume we have got an object with a few functions:</p>

<pre><code>var o = {
    times: function(num, multi)
    {
        return num * multi;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>We can now add this function to our running instance <code>app</code>:</p>

<pre><code>app.extend(o);
</code></pre>

<p>Or we can hook it on all running instances, as well as equip all future instances with it:</p>

<pre><code>exHelpExtend(o);
</code></pre>

<p>and then you can simply call</p>

<pre><code>app.times(2, 4); // = 8
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="best-practice" class="anchor" href="#best-practice"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Best practice</h1>

<p>In my opinion (or at least, this is how I do it) put all your functions inside your exHelp instance, this will make everything neat and organized, you can even add your own "subclasses" to keep everything categorized.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>var o = {
    custom: {
        myFnc1: function(e)
        {
            return e * e;
        },
        myFnc2: function(e)
        {
            // You can use this.
            return this.myFnc1(e) * e;
        },
        myFnc3: function(e)
        {
            // Or you can use your exHelp instance, if you have set it up as a global variable
            return app.custom.myFnc2(e) * e;
        }
    }
};
app.extend(o);
</code></pre>

<p>now you can easily access you new functions via:</p>

<pre><code>app.custom.myFnc1(2);
app.custom.myFnc2(4);
app.custom.myFnc3(8);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is a rudimentary way of setting up your exHelp instance. The graceful (and mobile friendly) way would be to load your "setup" code in a  self-executing function within a script file</p>

<pre><code>(function MyAppSetup(window)
{
})(window);
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know, this creates the function <code>MyAppSetup</code> within the scope of the parenthesis and then executes it since we have a trailing () after the parenthesis that hold the function. We pass the window variable for consistency. All of this ensures that the function will be executed as soon as the javascript file is done loading as well as keeping all local variables enclosed within the scope of our "quasi-constructor".</p>

<p>Best case you want the file to even load asynchronously (so it doesn't block rendering of the websites, e.g. on mobile devices), so we add this little tidbit at the top of out constructor:</p>

<pre><code>(function MyAppSetup(window)
{
    if (window['exHelp'] == void 0)
        return setTimeout(MyAppSetup, 100, window);
})(window);
</code></pre>

<p>This checks whether <code>exHelp</code> exists in the global <code>window</code> (We compare to <code>void 0</code> instead of <code>undefined</code> and use the array annotation instead of object to avoid fatal errors during script execution which would block everything else from working.</p>

<p>So if <code>exHelp</code> doesn't exist globally (which it exposes itself to after initialization), it stops execution right there, then tries again in 100 ms (which in most cases is more than enough), which also explains why we don't use an anonymous function here. We need the name to be able to call it again.</p>

<p>So now we have to different paths we can go, either you want to make an exHelp Plugin (Like exHelp Date Helper) or you want to actually develop your system with it, depending on which you want to do, we have to do slightly different things (but easy enough to remember) - but remember, the plugin way <em>always</em> works!</p>

<h2>
<a name="plugin" class="anchor" href="#plugin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugin</h2>

<pre><code>(function MyPluginSetup(window)
{
    if (window['exHelp'] == void 0)
        return setTimeout(MyPluginSetup, 100, window);

    var myPlugin =
        {
            myFunction: function (a, b)
            {
                return parseInt(a) * parseInt(b);
            },
            anotherFunction: function(a)
            {
                return myPlugin.myFunction(a, a * 2);
            }
        };

    window.exHelpExtend(myPlugin);
})(window);
</code></pre>

<p>You create your object that holds all functions of your plugin, then extend the exHelp base object, so that all future instances will also contain this functionality - Don't worry about instances that you have already created, exHelp will extend those too!</p>

<p>Within a plugin, you either back-reference with the <code>this</code> keyword or if you need a function from a different scope of your plugin, you use the object name that you are initializing it with.</p>

<h2>
<a name="system" class="anchor" href="#system"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System</h2>

<pre><code>(function MyAppSetup(window)
{
    if (window['exHelp'] == void 0)
        return setTimeout(MyAppSetup, 100, window);

    var myapp = new exHelp();

    // Extending is optional, but recommended
    var baseExtension =
        {
            info:
                {
                    AppName: "My App",
                    Version: "1.0.0",
                    Author: "Leroy Jenkins"
                },

            myFunction: function (a, b)
            {
                return parseInt(a) * parseInt(b);
            }
        };

    myapp.extend(baseExtension);

    // Expose
    window.m = myapp;
})(window);
</code></pre>

<p>So you want to actually USE exHelp? Follow the design outlined above. You instantiate exHelp into a variable - optionally you can also extend your exHelp object with your own functions here (which you will want to do) and then extend them TO YOUR OBJECT (here <code>myapp</code>). Keep in mind that doing so will only affect the current exHelp instance, if you want all other instances to also inherit them you will have to use the plugin method describes above.</p>

<p>Finally, for convenience you can then expose your local variable <code>myapp</code> to the global scope <code>window</code>. I like to use one-letter names, since those are quick and easy to type and then swiftly enable you to program with ease. It also helps to get back into the exHelp scope from outside. Of course, for security reasons you might want to keep everything executing from within the scope and not expose it globally, but that is the beauty of this very lightweight system: It is all up to you, I only give you the rudimentary tools.</p>
